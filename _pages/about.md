Usman is a fourth year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Florida International University Miami, FL, USA. He received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan in 2014 and an M.S degree in Computer Engineering from Western Michigan University in 2018. He was a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Western Michigan University from 2016 to 2018 and currently working as a Graduate Research Assistantin at Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences at Florida International University. His research interests include developing Artificially Intelligent algorithms for Big-Data processing in Bioinformatics, high-performance computing, parallel and distributed algorithm design, and reconfigurable architectures.

As part of his Ph.D. research, Usman came up with the idea of developing a deep-learning model for learning the representation across different modalities of data, including sequence, numerical and image data, to improve protein sequencing accuracy. Applying the concepts of attention-based learning, representation learning, generative models, and cross-modal similarity networks, he designed such a model called [SpeCollate](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259349). It performs exceptionally well over the existing methods providing up to 99% peptide identification accuracy. Usman also helped in writing a US$1 million grant proposal containing the above idea as a significant part.

In addition to developing original research agendas, Usman is also working on projects requiring extensive internal and external collaboration and coordination. In December 2021, he authored multiple research papers where he designed graph based algorithms for processing and analyzing comprehensive mass-spectrometry data to understand the structural similaries in Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM). The project was done in collaboration with researchers from Biology and Chemistry departments. Moreover, he has enjoyed designing algorithms for numerous applications, including genomic data compression, fMRI/image classification for ASD detection, and machine learning solutions for bioinformatics pipelines.
